Object Oriented Programming.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In This Assignment we were tasked with Converting a program that takes GPS coordiantes and turns them into a plot. The Program itself is coded in C and we are tasked with converting to C#. These are the initial requirements for that.
Needs to use command line arguments in exactly the same way (will need to run like this: dotnet run -- data/example.dat output/example.svg)
Uses file I/O
Uses classes and objects as the primary data and process abstraction methodology
Uses an enumerated type
Uses a list
Uses namespaces
Has enough error handling to exit gracefully if there is a problem (i.e. if the input file is not found or there is a problem in the file)
However, there are also additional requirements to this task:-
Object Oriented Principles:
Data and Process Abstraction √
User defined types √
Encapsulation (Information Hiding) √
Abstract Data type:
"The representation of objects of the type is hidden from the program units 
that use the type, so the only direct operations possible on those objects are 
those provided in the type’s definition."√
"The declarations of the type and the protocols of the operations on objects 
of the type, which provide the type’s interface, are contained in a single 
syntactic unit. The type’s interface does not depend on the representation 
of the objects or the implementation of the operations. Also, other program 
units are allowed to create variables of the defined type." √
Managed access √
Managed Creation and Destruction √
Hiding of the implementation (i.e. it is a secret) √
Parameterization (Generics, specialization to one type) √
Overloading (works for multiple types) ×
Inheritance √ 
Overriding √
Abstract classes √
Class variables/methods vs. instance variables/methods √
Polymorphism √
Dynamic binding and dispatch ×

I do Believe I did all the requirements as according to ChatGPT (will be attached). The code is compliant with the tasks
I don't have the full history as I opened and closed a bunch of sessions trying to make heads or tails of this initally. However, I attached the important ones to me at the very least that helped me understand C code and C#.
ChatGPT did help more help than the history attached shows even when it did mislead sometimes. As long as I adjusted my prompt it helped me come up with parts of the so code.
So technically It's a co-Author of this. I didn't try to look up the history of the errors as they are spread out in multiple sessions where the prompt I wrote failed me and Chatgpt misunderstood what I needed at that point.
All in all however, its a useful tool and a great co-programmer.
