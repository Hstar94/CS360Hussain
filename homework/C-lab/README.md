In this Assginment we were given a file called "placeholder.c" which contained C code that generated a blank .png
The start of the assginment was just us addressing two simple issues with the file. 

For me considering I installed WSL and my GNU C compiler a bit late I thought I had issues with my install. Thankfully I used chatgpt to help me troubleshoot that.
Granted I didn't keep exact transcripts (as I tried to keep my chatgpt history a bit organized) I'll post close replicas. I also used it for linux commands and what not as I'm not as familar with those. For example I know how cd works but to make it faster for me to navigate all of this "C:\Users\h_alh\Documents\GitHub\CS360-F23-ClassRepo\homework\C-lab" I just asked chatgpt to generate me the path for it so I can access it.

Noticed RAM usage was high on my PC after I was done with WSL for the session:

Garbage Collection question for placeholder.c (recreated as I removed the older one):

Though with this one example I've noticed that it 

Another thing I've tried with chatgpt and it might be my prompt that caused this. I was curious as to how it would generate the bullseye.png we are trying to generate. And in both trials I've gotten some interesting results that I will upload to git.

Overall my issues were navigation and learning how C works compared to C++ and making sure garbage collection is handled properly which thanks to Language models like chatgpt it was straight forward for the most part. I did have some code related questions but I can't find the correct session for them as I've been using that to learn Blender, Unreal Engine 5 and what not and their history is a bit of a mess to go through so I tend to delete sessions that I'm done with. I tried to replicate what I can here.
